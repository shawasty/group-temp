There's nothing wrong with me, I'm OK
It's only because recently been kind of Grey that I feel down
I know what I'm aiming for

It ain't that hard to do
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
There's nothing wrong with you, you're OK
It's only because things don't always go your way that you feel down
Hey what you waiting for?
Don't think so much about everything and let the day take over
It ain't that hard to do
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
Hey, what you waiting for?
Don't think so much about everything and let the day take over
It ain't that hard to do
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
